# Nintendulator DX

Nintendulator DX is a special build of Nintendulator that allows debugging. If installed, it allows for the `make debug` command.
This adds a debugger which understands debug output generated by our compiler, which allows it to map machine code back to 
actual assembly code. (With comments!)
