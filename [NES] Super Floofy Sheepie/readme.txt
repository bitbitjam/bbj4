Super Floofy Sheepie is a game written entirely in assembly language, for the NES. Coded for #bitbitjam4 with the theme of "velcro sheep" with an input restriction of just one button.

You must time your button presses to collect all the floof balls in each level whilst avoiding wolves, then escaping to your sheepy house, and moving onto the next level of course.

Until recently I'd never played with Assembly language so it proved very challenging just to get as far as I have done.

There's still a lot of code to be written and it only weights in at 12kb total currently (4kb of code, 8kb of CHR ROM) Leaving a lot of scope for improvement and features.

I'll be finishing this one in due course but am, frankly, shattered currently so may leave it for a week or two first ;)
