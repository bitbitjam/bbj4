## Super Floofy Sheepie - refreshgames (NES)

![img](/[NES]%20Super%20Floofy%20Sheepie/title.jpg?raw=true) ![img](/[NES]%20Super%20Floofy%20Sheepie/ingame.jpg?raw=true)

You must time your button presses to collect all the floof balls in each level whilst avoiding wolves, then escaping to your sheepy house, and moving onto the next level of course. Game written entirely in assembly language, for the NES. Until recently I'd never played with Assembly language so it proved very challenging just to get as far as I have done.

You're a magnetic velcro sheep - you're sheeping it up. A giant magnet circles around you and pulls you around, 
but thankfully the ground is covered in velcro too. Cling to it (using A) to control your movement and escape.
