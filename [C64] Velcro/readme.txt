Become Velcro, the world's best shepherd dog!

Velcro has been born with a unique mutation: His fur has tiny hooks, which attach to a woolly sheep on contact. This way, Velcro can gather the sheep faster than any other dog!

In the game, the dog is running all the time in circles. Hold space to change the circle direction.

This game was made for #bitbitjam4 in 2017.
