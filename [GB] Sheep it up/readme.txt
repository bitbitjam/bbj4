"Sheep it up!" is a one-button arcade game where a sheep has to climb up by hanging himself to flying Velcro straps.

This is an actual GameBoy game, designed to run any GameBoy compatible hardware: the original "fat" model (DMG), the GameBoy Pocket, the GameBoy Color or the GameBoy Advance. Of course, you can also play it using any GameBoy emulator available, including Gamejoltâ€™s one.
