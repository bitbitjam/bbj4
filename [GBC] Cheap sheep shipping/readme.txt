Short game made for the bitbitJAM4 from June 30th to July 7th of 2017
with "Velcro Ship" thematics and "Just one key" restriction. You're
starting a small business carrying sheeps between different places 
in the tall tall lands, and you just have a really cheap helicopter
(with velcro base for carrying them) with just ONE button for do the
work. Try to don't crash and get your clients proud, happy and fluffy!

=====================================================================
								HOW TO PLAY
								
In each mission you will need to accomplish the following tasks:

*	Take off with your cheap helicopter (just try to don't crash :D)
*	Search the sheep, and pick it from the ground. Search the UP
	arrow sign, sheep is there.
*	Take the sheep in it's destination, in the ground. Search the
	DOWN arrow sign, where's the place that you must release it.
*	Return safely to the heliport.

Controls:
								
	Hold B Button	: Excecute helicopter action.
	Release B Button: Change helicopter action.
	
	(Also B button for navigate in the menus).

					DEVELOPER FLU's... er, sorry, TOUGHT'S.
					
This is my second year participating in a bitbitJAM. My first attempt
was in 2016 with Hilda (http://gamejolt.com/games/hilda/162284), a 
game for SNES by Orochii Zouveleki and me... Well, for various
reasons, work & time mainly, he won't be able to participate this
time :( (But sure he can join next time :) ). Soooo, this time I go
solo.

It was really difficult develop a game in the jam week: There's 
winter in my hemisphere, I'm working full-time too, I caught a flu
in the middle of the week and also another minor time-killing issues,
so this year was more like "Do an interesting thing in time" rather
than "Do something with quality". If you take a peek at the source
code you will be scared instantly! Lots of spaghetti code with
unoptimized sentences (I sure I can made this with 4 banks instead 8)
and lots, LOTS of hours debugging crashes (real ones, not helicopter
based haha). So, if you're downloaded this and you can read this
lines, that means I can finished this in time. Hahaha.

For the time, the excellent Zal0's ZGB framework for Gameboy 
(https://github.com/Zal0/ZGB) helped a LOT, avoiding doing some 
common things that you do when you doing a old-school project from
scratch. He made this framework in past bitbitJAM3 with his game
Princess Castle Escape and released it in github. If you want to
make GB games and you need a good base to start for, I surely can
recommend it. Is GBDK based and the layout of the elements is 
very clean. :D

Some final toughts, whenever cons in this week, I have a lot of fun
making this, and hope you will enjoy it too! :) Hope next year it
will reach this jam again, but no idea of which console I would
choose... 

(Bad english? Don't judge me, I tried XD!)

=====================================================================
								SOURCE CODE

One of the main ideas from bitbitJAM is share code: That will help
future developers to see how old-school games are made of (excluding
the big quantities of tears and non-sleep hours haha). So, in this
package there's the source code of this game included. 

Don't look at code clean-ness, it was a COMPLETELY MESS! (I've warned
you)... But, what do you want? Is a damn 7-day jam for an old-school
device. (Yeah, I would wish to clean this but I do not have any time
for anything this year :( ... I got a flu in mid of the week but I
still able to publish the game sucesfully... or I think so haha).

This piece of work is made thanks by the powerful ZGB framework
(https://github.com/Zal0/ZGB) , you will need it if you want to
compile the project yourself.
