Enjoy the latest adventures of Sticky Hooves and dive into ancient Mayan templs to find their treasure!

Story

This is the story about the irish sheep Sticky Hooves.
He and his girlfriend Marry came to America to live their dreams!
They've spent all their money to start a new and better live, but unfortunately Marry got sick and because of the bad health care system, they can't afford the treatment.
Of course there was only one way to pay their debt...

Since Sticky once was an archaeologist, he travelled to ancient Mayan temples in order to find their treasures and to pay his debt!

Gameplay

You play as the sheep Sticky Hooves and dive into ancient Mayan ruins. Since the actual game is only allowed to use one button, Sticky runs automatically and the only option you have, is to jump (A-Button).
The old temple of Vel-Cro was built by an ancient society, which has mastered the technology of velcro thousand of years ago. Therefore certain parts of the temple's ceiling are made out of velcro, which allows a fluffy sheep to walk along those ceilings.
