Something extremely weird has happened in Grazalema! All the sheep of the flock have been captured in mysterious giant bubbles!

Help Polka Sheep rescue his friends using his velcro powers! He can get fastened to all velcro surfaces around. Avoid hundreds of evil wolves, thousands of kawaii parrots and millions of poisoned spikes to liberate all your friends!! It's an epic fight to restore peace in the flock.

Use A button to fix your jump direction and release A to jump. You control Polka Sheep with just one finger!! What is this?? This is INSANITY!!!

    Use the built-in game boy emulator in GameJolt.
